%		Estimate scale factors and offsets for measurements from a triaxial
%		field sensor. This function uses an iterative approximate least-squares
%		method to estimate the scale factors, temperature sensitivity and
%		offsets needed to make the magnitude of X close to the expected field 
%		strength. This function removes data that are changing rapidly as these
%		can have greater errors (e.g., due to specific acceleration). The function
%		also tries to balance the data so that a roughly equal number of measurements
%		from a wide range of orientations are processed. See spherical_cal for
%		a more powerful data-driven calibration method for short data sets.
%
%     Inputs:
%		X is a sensor structure or matrix containing measurements from a
%		 triaxial field sensor such as an accelerometer or magnetometer.
%		 X can be in any units and frame.
%     T is a sensor structure or vector of temperature in degrees Celsius.
%		 T must be at the same sampling rate as X. Put [] in this field if
%		 temperature compensation is not required.
%     fs is the sampling rate of the sensor data in Hz (samples per second).
%		 This is only needed if X is not a sensor structure. X and T 
%      must both have the same sampling rate (use decdc.m or resample.m 
%		 if needed to achieve this).
%		fstr is the expected field strength at the measurement location in
%		 the same units as X.
%     prct is the percentage of low jerk points to be kept. Default value 
%      is 2% but a larger value may be needed if A is small.
%
%     Results:
%		X is a sensor structure or matrix containing the adjusted triaxial
%		 sensor measurements. It is the same size and has the same sampling
%		 rate and units as the input data. If the input is a sensor structure,
%		 the output will be also.
%		G is a calibration structure containing the offset, gain, and temperature
%		 sensitivities deduced by the function.
%		G.poly is a matrix of polynomials. The first column of G.poly is the 
%		 three scale factors applied to the columns of X. The second column 
%		 is the offset added to each column of X after scaling.
%		G.tcomp is the temperature compensation polynomial for each axis.
%		G.tref is the reference temperature which is always 20 degrees Celsius.
%
%		Note: this function is only usable for field sensors. It will not work
%		for gyroscope data.

%		 load...
